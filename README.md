# Project Goal

I found it difficult to find examples online where a React application communicates with a Spring Boot backend using OAuth 2.0, including handling tokens within React, user authentication in the session, and refresh token management on the backend.

So, I created this project to debug and refine the OAuth 2.0 interaction between React and the backend for myself.

# React OAuth 2.0 with Spring Boot

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

NextJS Version 13!

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
```

then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

On Server please user **reddit** to cache the jwt-tokens.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
